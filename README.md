# Route-service

Main goal of this project is to find the best route from one country to another. Data is presented as json format.

I've implemented A* pathfinding algorithm to find the best route with the help of [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-a-star-pathfinding) from Baeldung and [this video](https://youtu.be/ySN5Wnu88nE) from Computerphile.




## Build & Run

* You can execute `gradle build` and then run the output jar located at `/build/libs` 
* I also prepared Dockerfile so you can also build the image and run the application 
* You also can run it with any supported IDE
